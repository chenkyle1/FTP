HIGH-LEVEL APPROACH:
I first reviewd File transfer protocol and its features. I then setup two sockets. One for control connections and the other for data connections. Then I implemented logging into the server. Then I implemented the commands in order of what was suggested. 

CHALLENGES:
I had trouble uploading the file as there was type errors when sending, decoding ,and encoding.

STRATEGY:
My strategy was to slowly progress by trying to get the next message from the server. I also used try and catch to find where the error is.

TESTING:
I would print out messages from the server. I also compared expected behaviour with fileZilla. This makes it easier to check which command worked and didnt work.
